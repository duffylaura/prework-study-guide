# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This website serves as an organizer of content and how-to information during the prework module at UC Berkeley's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. 

Historically, bootcamp students struggle with organizing all the information that they recieve throughout the course. 

This is one possible solution for the information recieved during the prework module. 

From this development process I learned the basics of creating a website.
